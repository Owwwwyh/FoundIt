# FoundIt — Campus Lost & Found Hub

A full-stack single-page web app for SECJ3483 Web Technology.
**Stack:** Vue.js SPA · PHP Slim REST API · MySQL (PDO) · JWT auth.

## 🌐 Live demo
- **App:** https://foundit-app-beta.vercel.app
- **API:** https://foundit261.alwaysdata.net/api
- **User login:** `aisha@example.com` / `password123` (sample users)
- **Admin login:** `admin@example.com` / `password123` (moderation dashboard)

Frontend hosted on **Vercel** · backend + **MySQL** on **AlwaysData**.

> **CI/CD:** the GitHub repo is connected to Vercel — every push to `main` automatically
> builds and deploys the frontend (root directory `foundit-app/`). No manual deploy step.

## ✨ Features

**Core**
- 🔐 **Accounts & auth** — register / log in, JWT-protected routes, bcrypt-hashed passwords
- 🔑 **Forgot password** — request a reset link by email, then set a new password via a secure, single-use, 30-minute link
- 📋 **Post lost & found items** — title, category, location, date, description
- 🔎 **Browse & filter** — keyword search + filter by type (lost/found), category and status
- 🙋 **Claims workflow** — file a claim with proof; the poster approves/rejects. Approving resolves the item and auto-rejects the other pending claims (transaction-safe)
- 📊 **Dashboard** — manage the items you posted and track the claims you filed

**Bonus**
- 📷 **Photo upload** — attach a photo per item (JPG/PNG/WEBP/GIF, 2 MB; real image-type validation, owner-only)
- 📧 **Email notifications** — poster is emailed when a claim is filed; claimant is emailed when it's approved/rejected (PHPMailer + SMTP — set `MAIL_*` in `.env`; gracefully skipped if unconfigured)
- 🤝 **Smart match suggestions** — opening a *lost* item suggests likely matching *found* items (and vice versa), ranked by category, shared keywords, location and date

**Advanced add-ons**
- 🛡️ **Admin role + moderation dashboard** — a second role beyond normal users. Admins get a `/admin` dashboard with campus-wide stats (totals, **resolved rate**, items by status/category, claim counts) and can moderate **any** item (force status / delete). Includes a **users & their missing items** table — every user's reported-lost belongings with the last location each was seen and how long it has been missing (*time to be found*, which flips to "Found" once resolved), with search/status filtering. Enforced server-side with role-based JWT + `AdminMiddleware`, on top of the existing per-owner checks.
- 🏆 **"Most lost" podium** — the home page shows a gold/silver/bronze podium of the top-3 categories students lose most, ranked live from the database. Hidden automatically when there's no data.
- 🗺️ **Campus map location picker** — pin where an item was lost/found on an interactive **Leaflet** + OpenStreetMap map when reporting it; the point (and AI-suggested places) are shown on the item page. Ties the app directly to "campus."
- 🤖 **AI location hints** — a **local probabilistic scorer** ranks the places a user has recently been to and suggests where an item is likely to turn up. It blends four signals: *temporal proximity* to the report date, *visit frequency*, *category/keyword affinity*, and optional *distance clustering* (Haversine) when map points exist. Results are stored on the item as `ai_location_hints`. If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set it adds a short natural-language summary, with a **graceful offline fallback** when it isn't.

## Setup & run

> **Quick start (Windows):** once the one-time setup below is done, just double-click
> **`RUN-FOUNDIT.bat`** in this folder — it starts MySQL, the backend (`:8081`), and the
> frontend (`:5173`) in their own windows and opens the app. Log in with `aisha@example.com` / `password123`.

### 1. Database
```bash
mysql -u root -p < foundit-api/database/schema.sql
```
The sample users are seeded with a real bcrypt hash, so you can log in straight away with the
password **`password123`** (e.g. `aisha@example.com`, `ben@example.com`, `citra@example.com`,
or the admin account `admin@example.com`).

> **Already have a `foundit` database?** Don't drop it — run the additive migration instead,
> which adds the `role`, `latitude`, `longitude` and `ai_location_hints` columns and promotes
> the admin account (safe to re-run):
> ```bash
> mysql -u root -p foundit < foundit-api/database/migration_features.sql
> ```

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd foundit-api
composer install
copy .env.example .env       # (Windows)  — then edit DB creds + JWT_SECRET
                             # (optional) set OPENAI_API_KEY to enrich AI hints
php -S localhost:8081 -t public
```
Test: open http://localhost:8081/api/items — should return JSON.

### 3. Frontend
```bash
cd foundit-app
npm install
copy .env.example .env       # VITE_API_BASE = http://localhost:8081/api
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173.

> If you see a CORS error, make sure `CORS_ORIGIN` in the backend `.env` exactly matches the frontend URL.

## Who builds what

| Member | Files | Builds |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** Backend Lead | `AuthController.php` | register + login + password hashing + JWT issuing |
| **M2** Backend | `ItemController.php`, `ClaimController.php` | all SQL queries, validation, status codes |
| **M3** Frontend Lead | `Register.vue` (+ owns router/store/App) | auth UI, route guards, token handling |
| **M4** Frontend | `Home.vue`, `ItemDetail.vue`, `PostItem.vue`, `Dashboard.vue` | feature screens, forms, async calls |

## Build order
1. Import the database, fix password hashes.
2. **M1:** finish login → `POST /api/login` returns a token.
3. **M2:** `GET /api/items` returns the seeded items.
4. **M3:** log in from the UI → navbar shows protected links. **← key milestone.**
5. **M2 + M4:** full CRUD + claims workflow.
6. Deploy: backend + MySQL to AlwaysData, frontend to Vercel.

## Demo testing checklist
- [ ] Register → log in → token stored
- [ ] Forgot password → reset link emailed → set a new password → log in with it
- [ ] Open `/post` while logged out → redirected to `/login`
- [ ] Create / edit / delete an item
- [ ] File a claim; owner approves/rejects
- [ ] `POST /api/items` with no token → **401**
- [ ] Edit someone else's item → **403**
- [ ] Invalid form → **422** with messages
- [ ] Upload a photo to an item → shows on the card and detail page *(bonus #1)*
- [ ] File a claim → poster receives an email; approve/reject → claimant receives one *(bonus #2, needs SMTP in `.env`)*
- [ ] Open a lost item → "Possible matches" lists likely found items *(bonus #3)*
- [ ] Report an item → drop a pin on the campus map → it shows on the item page *(advanced: map picker)*
- [ ] Open an item → "AI location hints" lists ranked places with reasons; owner can refresh *(advanced: AI scorer)*
- [ ] Home page shows the **"Most lost"** podium (gold/silver/bronze top-3 lost categories)
- [ ] Log in as `admin@example.com` → "Admin" link appears → dashboard shows stats and can delete any item *(advanced: admin role)*
- [ ] Admin console shows the **users & their missing items** table (last location + time to be found + search/status filter)
- [ ] Log in as a normal user → opening `/admin` redirects home; `GET /api/admin/stats` → **403** *(role-based authorization)*
- [ ] Works at the live public URL
